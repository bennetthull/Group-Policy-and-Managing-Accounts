I logged into my Windows Server Domain Controller VM via remote desktop. Then I opened Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) and went to edit my default domain policy. I selected "computer configuration", "policies", "Windows Settings", "Security Settings", "Account Policies", "Account Lockout Policy". I set the account lockout threshold to 5 invalid logon attempts with a 30 minute lockout duration.

After that, I logged in as an Admin into my Client-1 Windows 10 VM as an admin. Rather than wait the 90 minutes for the group policy to take effect, I ran the command "gpupdate /force" to enable it immediately. I then selected one of the users I generated in a previous project from a Powershell script and attempted to login to Client-1 6 times with a bad password.

I then joined my Windows 10 VM, "Client 1" to my domain (mydomain.com). I previously had set Client 1's DNS settings to my Domain Controller's private IP address. After logging in as an admin, I went to Client 1's system properties and allowed domain users access to remote desktop. I then logged back into my Domain Controller as davin_admin. I subsequently ran a Powershell script as an administrator to create 10,000 accounts for the _EMPLOYEES OU. Lastly, I confirmed the functionality of the user accounts by signing in with one of them.
